# Advanced Slime Paper (ASWM)

Advanced Slime Paper is a fork of Paper implementing the Slime Region Format developed by Hypixel. Originally a plugin, this project has been converted to a
fork to maximize our ability to provide fixes and performance improvements.
Its goal is to provide server administrators with an easy-to-use tool to load worlds faster and save space.
